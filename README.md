# Enigma
 A simulation of the famous Enigma machine during WWII that encompasses both encryption and decryption functions. This simulation can work with more characters than the original version.
## Documentation
I only summarized the usage of this simulation. Please refer to this link for a comprehensive documentation about how the project was built as well as how the configuration file/input file/output file should look like: https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs61b/fa21/materials/proj/proj1/index.html
- First, compile all of the files with `javac -g -Xlint:unchecked enigma/*.java`.
- After compiling, you can use the command `java -ea enigma.Main [configuration file] [input file] [output file]` to run the program.
## Confidentiality
- A CS61B project of UC Berkeley.
- Completed in Fall 2021.
